# Ecosystem


This is a simulation of an ecosystem that involves carnivores, herbivores and plants.
The foodchain goes like this:
  Carnivore eat herbivores
  Herbivores eat plants
  Plants will grow back every once in a while at a certain time
  Carnviores can mate with other carnivores to reproduce
  Herbovires and mate with other herbivores to reproduce
  
The system includes a few gui to help you get started.
