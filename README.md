# Ecosystem


This is a simulation of an ecosystem that involves carnivores, herbivores and plants.
The foodchain goes like this:

  * Carnivore eat herbivores
  * Herbivores eat plants
  * Plants will grow back every once in a while at a certain time
  * Carnviores can mate with other carnivores to reproduce
  * Herbovires and mate with other herbivores to reproduce
  
The system includes a few gui to help you get started.

  By default:
  * 10% of the ecosystem will be carnivores
  * 20% will be herbivores
  * 30% will be plants
  * 40% will be empty space
  * The size of ecosystem will be 30x30

Example of ecosystem running.
This is day 8:
  * `@` represents carnivores
  * `&` represents herbivores
  * `*` represents plants
  * `.` represents empty space
